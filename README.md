## Description
This is a  simple web application that gives users the
opportunity to quickly find new books to read based on genres
that interest them, and to check out book reviews as well.
This makes it easy to find new books but also make sure that
those books are worth reading. 

On a personal level, I figured this would be a nice, simple project
to work on since books are incredibly useful, but also to showcase my
skills using APIs and displaying information about them to the user.
